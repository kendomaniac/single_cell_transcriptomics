# single_cell_transcriptomics
Repository for exemplary data used in single cell transcriptomics chapters
The GEO dataset GSM3618014 includes the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H2228, H1975, A549, H838 and HCC827 mixed at the same ratio [[Tian et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30096152/)]. annotated_GSM3618014_gene_count.csv.zip dataset is derived from GSM3618014, by adding the symbols to ensembl ids
RNA-5c_clustering.output.csv.zip cell type annotation file from Alessandri et al. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1275.
RNA-5c.csv.zip count table ready to be used as example. Cells identifiers include the cell type they belong.

The GEO dataset [GSM4679532](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4679532) was used as an example for some of the methods described in Springer book on single cell transcriptomics edited by Raffaele A Calogero and Vladimir Benes. GSM4679532 is part of the [GSE154778](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154778) dataset published by Lin and coworkers [[Lin et al. 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32988401/)].
