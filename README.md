# single_cell_transcriptomics
Repository for exemplary data used in single cell transcriptomics chapters
annotated_GSM3618014_gene_count.csv.zip dataset from GSM3618014 to which the symbols have been added
RNA-5c_clustering.output.csv.zip cell type annotation file from Alessandri et al. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1275.
RNA-5c.csv.zip count table ready to be used as example. Cells identifiers include the cell type they belong.

The GEO dataset [GSM4679532](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4679532) was used as an example for some of the methods described in Springer book on single cell transcriptomics edited by Raffaele A Calogero and Vladimir Benes. GSM4679532 is part of the [GSE154778](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154778) dataset published by Lin and coworkers [[Lin et al. 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32988401/)].
